This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

The link you provided is for downloading ChromeDriver, which is necessary for using Selenium with Google Chrome. Here’s a quick guide on how to download and set up ChromeDriver:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. **Download ChromeDriver**

1. **Go to the ChromeDriver download page:**
   [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads)

2. **Choose the version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed version of Chrome.** The download page should list versions and links for different operating systems. 

3. **Download the appropriate file** for your operating system:
   - For **Windows**, download `chromedriver_win32.zip`.
   - For **Mac**, download `chromedriver_mac64.zip`.
   - For **Linux**, download `chromedriver_linux64.zip`.

#### 2. **Extract ChromeDriver**

- **Windows:** Extract the `chromedriver_win32.zip` file. This will give you a `chromedriver.exe` file.
- **Mac/Linux:** Extract the `chromedriver_mac64.zip` or `chromedriver_linux64.zip` file. This will give you a `chromedriver` file.

#### 3. **Place ChromeDriver in a Known Directory**

- **Windows:** Place `chromedriver.exe` in a directory of your choice, such as `C:\chromedriver`.
- **Mac/Linux:** Place the `chromedriver` file in a directory such as `/usr/local/bin` or any other directory in your `PATH`.

#### 4. **Update Your Script to Use ChromeDriver**

In your Selenium script, you need to specify the path to the ChromeDriver executable. Replace `/path/to/chromedriver` with the path where you placed ChromeDriver:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Set up the WebDriver (you need to specify the path to your ChromeDriver)
service = Service('/path/to/chromedriver')  # Update this path
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)

# URL of the page to scrape
page_url = "https://www.education.gov.za/Curriculum/LearningandTeachingSupportMaterials(LTSM)/DigitalContent.aspx"

# Open the page
driver.get(page_url)

# Allow some time for the page to load
time.sleep(5)

# Find all links on the page
links = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, 'a')

# Filter and collect download links
download_links = [link.get_attribute('href') for link in links if link.get_attribute('href') and link.get_attribute('href').endswith('.pdf')]

# Save the links to a file
with open('urls.txt', 'w') as file:
    for link in download_links:
        if link:
            file.write(link + '\n')

print("All download links have been saved to urls.txt")

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

### Additional Tips:

- **Check Chrome Version:** Make sure the ChromeDriver version matches your installed version of Chrome. You can check your Chrome version by going to `chrome://settings/help` in your Chrome browser.
- **Environment Variables:** For convenience, you can add the path to ChromeDriver to your system’s `PATH` environment variable, so you don’t need to specify the full path in your script.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to successfully use ChromeDriver with Selenium to scrape the download links from the webpage.
